## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions! Before submitting a pull request, please open an issue to discuss your proposed changes. This helps us track changes even if PRs are closed or abandoned.

- Translations: When adding a new language, please specify the region (e.g., French vs. Canadian French). If starting with a general version, that's fineâ€”just ensure to rename appropriately if regional variants are added later.
- PR Previews: We offer PR previews deployed to Cloudflare, allowing contributors to push updates and review changes.
